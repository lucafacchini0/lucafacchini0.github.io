### Hi there! I'm Luca Facchini

I'm a 17-year-old student from Italy with a huge passion for computer science and technology. Right now, I'm getting ready for a new academic adventure while diving deep into **penetration testing**, **networking**, and **coding**. 

### My Journey

My tech journey started when I was just 12 years old and wrote my very first "Hello World" programâ€”how cool is that? A year later, I stumbled upon the fascinating world of **malware** and **virtualization**. I became so obsessed with learning how viruses like W@nnaCry and Petya worked. I spent hours watching YouTube videos, especially those by [Siam Alam](https://www.youtube.com/@SiamAlamOfficial), and even set up virtual machines just to see how antivirus software would deal with them. Back then, it felt like a video game to meâ€”I had no idea how advanced it really was for a 12-year-old!

After that, I tried (and failed) a bunch of times to set up my own **Minecraft server**. I had no clue about **Linux** or how to manage a VPS, and each failure was super frustrating, but I learned so much. Now, I can set up a Minecraft server with no problem at all, and those early failures? They've become some of my favorite memories, teaching me the value of persistence.

As I kept learning, I started building my first websites using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**â€”they weren't exactly masterpieces, yeah, but they were a start! Learning JavaScript opened up a whole new world for me, leading me to explore **Python** and eventually **C/C++**. This phase helped me really understand how systems work, from RAM to the core logic behind computing.

### What I'm Up to Now

These days, I'm all about **penetration testing and cybersecurity**. I'm getting deep into **Linux**, mastering security tools, and exploring the amazing world of networks. There's something incredibly satisfying about untangling the complexities of systems and seeing how everything connects. It's mind-blowing to think that I can send a request to Google and get a response in just secondsâ€”how INSANE is that?

I'm really excited about where this path will take me. I'm ready to embrace challenges, learn from my mistakes, and grow stronger with each experience.

### Looking Ahead

In the future, I plan to pursue a degree in **Computer Engineering** at **Politecnico di Milano (PoliMi) ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹**, focusing on **cybersecurity**. After that, I'd love to continue my studies at **ETH Zurich**, in Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ where I can dive into cutting-edge research and innovation.

Ultimately, my dream is to work as a **penetration tester**â€”whether for a company or as a freelancer. The idea of securing systems and networks against threats really excites me, and I'm eager to contribute to making the digital world a safer place.

> Having a passion is what keeps a person alive, and instead of wasting my time, I strive to improve myself every day. I used to be a really shy guy, and in many ways, my passion for computers kept me going. Now, Iâ€™m no longer shy, but Iâ€™ve held onto this passion, and I know it will stay with me forever.
